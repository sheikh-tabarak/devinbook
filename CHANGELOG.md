# Changelog

All notable changes to the **DevinBook** project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-11
### Added
- **"Financial Intelligence" Hub**: Launched a premium Blog system with high-quality, professional articles focusing on finance strategy, small business reporting, and security.
- **Dynamic SEO Automation**: Implemented automated Sitemap and Robots.txt generation using Next.js Metadata API, ensuring every new blog post is immediately discoverable by search engines.
- **Premium Editorial Design**: Created a distinct blog aesthetic with high-resolution generated imagery and sharp editorial typography optimized for readability.
- **Mobile App Synchronization**: Updated the React Native mobile application to version 1.3.3, synchronizing branding, versioning, and enterprise inquiry capabilities across all platforms.

### Changed
- **Conversion Optimization**: Standardized navigation labels to "Try Now" and "Go to App" across all touchpoints to create a more direct and inviting user journey.
- **Brand Consistency**: Consolidated all metadata and content attribution under the "Team Devinsol" identity.
- **Global Strategy**: Updated SEO and landing page copy to be currency-neutral, explicitly highlighting support for multi-currency transactions.

### Fixed
- **Favicon & Identity**: Optimized the icon system with vector SVG support and high-resolution (96x96) Desktop PNG icons.
- **Accessibility & Contrast**: Resolved "white-on-white" invisibility issues on blog pages by forcing high-contrast typography and overriding system dark-mode inversions for the editorial content.
- **Mobile Dependency Hub**: Resolved critical Metro bundling errors by correcting dependency version mismatches in the mobile project.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-01-24
### Added
- **Default Protection & Migration**: Implemented a "fail-safe" system for Categories and Accounts. Default items ("Other Expenses", "Other Income", "Main Wallet") are now protected from deletion.
- **Smart Transaction Migration**: When a category or account is deleted, all its associated transactions are now automatically moved to the default category/account, preventing data loss.
- **Improved Transaction Drawer**: Re-engineered the "Add Transaction" drawer with a side-by-side layout for icon and amount, optimizing vertical space for easier access to the "Add" button on mobile.

### Changed
- **Terminology Standardization**: Streamlined navigation and management labels, ensuring "CATEGORIES" is used consistently across the Manage page and entry forms.
- **UI Spacing**: Reduced excessive vertical padding in transaction forms to minimize scrolling on small screens.

### Fixed
- **Dark Mode Accessibility**: Resolved "white-on-white" contrast issues on the Transactions page and Share Report modal, ensuring active selection states are perfectly readable.
- **Account Filter Logic**: Fixed a bug where multiple account filter pills would highlight incorrectly; now only the active selection is visualized.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-24
### Added
- **Featured Accounts**: Users can now mark specific accounts as "Featured" to highlight their balances directly on the Dashboard overview card.
- **Dedicated Login Portal**: Implemented a standalone `/login` route with forced light-mode styling for a professional first-impression.
- **Account Management**: Added a full Edit Account system with visual badges for featured status.

### Changed
- **PWA Optimization**: Updated launch logic to skip the landing page and open directly into the Dashboard for installed app users.
- **Auth Redirection**: Implemented intelligent redirection logic that sends unauthenticated users to `/login` and authenticated users straight to the dashboard.
- **Transaction UI**: Enhanced entry card visibility with improved rounding, deeper shadows (`shadow-md`), and better background contrast.

### Fixed
- **Database Connection Persistence**: Resolved a critical production error (`bufferCommands = false`) by enabling Mongoose command buffering and implementing a middleware to ensure database readiness before processing requests.
- **Transaction Persistence**: Fixed a critical bug where the "Paid From / To" account selection was not being preserved during transaction edits.
- **ID Normalization**: Standardized ID handling between backend and frontend to ensure consistent account and category associations.
